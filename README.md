# Bing-Wallpaper-for-ChromeOS
Chrome extension that downloads daily picture from Bing and sets as Chromebook wallpaper. ChromeOS only!


## TODO

- Make proper options page
  - Show gallery of pictures available offline (already downloaded) and let set selected as wallpaper
  - Make downloads optional
  - Allow user to choose folder for downloads
  - Allow setting alarm's interval (checking for new wallpapers)
  - Let choose Stretch or Center options
- Rotate wallpapers
- Set minimum Chrome version in manifest.json (ES6)


## FIXME

- Latest wallpaper is re-downloaded somehow options ain't saved at first. Drives me nut this bug.
